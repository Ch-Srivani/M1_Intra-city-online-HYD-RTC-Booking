what:
This is an online busticket booking system for the intra city.
why :
This helps many to book ticket through online where any one can easily login through their mobile phones and easily book tickets.
This also makes an ontime journey which helps nowadays.
when:
This takes around 4 weeks time to implement.
By the first week I have a plan or idea which come up to do this project.
In the second week I will start building the project and completes by the end of third week.
And after the completion of code construction I perform the tesing where an output is recorded.
who:
This acts like a mediator between two user.
the first user is the public who login through the app.
and the end user is the RTC management in which they will be receiving the order which means the ticket booking.
how:
I am going to implement this with the help of software called Dev-c IDE to construct the code and also Virtual studio Code to check the program executing in multiplatforms.
